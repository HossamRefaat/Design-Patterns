# üéØ Design Patterns in C#

Welcome to the **Design Patterns in C#** repository!  
This project is a curated collection of commonly used **Object-Oriented Design Patterns** with real-world C# examples, focusing on readability, clarity, and practical use.

## üìå What Are Design Patterns?

> **Design patterns** are **proven and reusable solutions** to common software design problems.  
They are not finished designs but templates that can be used to solve particular design issues in different situations.

## üìö Pattern Categories

Design patterns are generally categorized into **three main types**:

### 1. üõ†Ô∏è Creational Patterns
Focus on **object creation mechanisms**, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

| Pattern            | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| Singleton          | Ensure a class has only one instance. |
| Factory Method     | Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. |
| Abstract Factory   | Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects. |
| Builder            | Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. |
| Prototype          | Create new objects by cloning existing ones. |

### 2. üß± Structural Patterns
Deal with **object composition** ‚Äî how classes and objects are combined to form larger structures.

| Pattern         | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| Adapter         | Convert one interface to another. |
| Decorator       | Add responsibilities to objects dynamically. |
| Composite       | Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly. |
| Facade          | Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. |
| Bridge          | Decouple abstraction from its implementation. |
| Proxy           | Control access to an object. |
| Flyweight       | Use sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently. |

### 3. ü§ù Behavioral Patterns
Concerned with **communication between objects** and the delegation of responsibilities.

| Pattern         | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| Strategy        | Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. |
| Observer        | Define a one-to-many dependency between objects. |
| Command         | Encapsulate a request as an object. |
| Mediator        | Reduce coupling between components by introducing a mediator object. |
| Chain of Responsibility | Pass a request through a
